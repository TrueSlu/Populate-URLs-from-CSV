# Auto link populater

Requires Node and Yarn.

1. Create `to-populate.txt`. Put a search term per line.
1. Create `urls.csv`. Add `term,url` in the first line. Add a second line by hitting `Enter` on your keyboard.
1. Run the `scraper.js` script.
1. It will search for every term in the list and output the URL of the first results to `urls.csv`


Note: obviously, this and my other scrapers aren't perfect, but they aren't meant to be. They're quick, dirty, and get the job done.
